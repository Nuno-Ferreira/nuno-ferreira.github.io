                Hi! My name is Nuno Ferreira. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for writing elegant code and solving complex problems. I'm experienced in Python, JavaScript, React, and Django, and have a background in Robotics. I'm currently looking for new opportunities to work on exciting projects and collaborate with talented developers.
            </p>
            <p>
            Programming is really a passion to me and even though I'm most experienced in Python, I really want to explore other programming languages and expand my knowledge on them.
            </p>
