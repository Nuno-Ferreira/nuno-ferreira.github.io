# Portfolio Website

This is my website where I will be posting my projects that I have worked on or ones that I am currently working on. 
I will want to have a blog built into the website so I can start documentating my journey and projects which will be essential especially for my Final Year Project which will require me to keep a blog of the project.

I will want to turn the website into something that tells you a litlle bit more about me and my personality. I'll want to include some of my interests and hobbies.
